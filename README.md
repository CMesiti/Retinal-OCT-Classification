# Retinal-OCT-Classification
Independent Research on Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Topography) image classification, OCT is a non-invasive diagnostic technique highlighting the retina's distinctive layers. This research is following what I have learned with the OpenCV library and working with images. The goal of this project is to learn how to build a neural network with pytorch and enhance my understanding on deep learning concepts. Eventually leading to an end product that is a multi-class OCT image classification model. 

> Some of this code, particularly the pytorch lesssons can be attributed to @danielBourke and his pytorch course on Youtube which I followed thoroughly https://www.youtube.com/@mrdbourke

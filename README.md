# Retinal-OCT-Classification
Independent Research on Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Topography) classification which is a non-invasive diagnostic technique. This research is following what I have learned with the OpenCV library and working with images.
> Some of this code, particularly the pytorch lesssons can be attributed to @danielBourke and his pytorch course on Youtube which I followed thoroughly https://www.youtube.com/@mrdbourke

## Research Topics

### Pytorch Introduction

### Reading and Using Datasets

### CNN Architecture/ Transfer Learning

### Models and Techniques
- Primary model choice was EfficientNetv2 with cross entropy loss function and the ADAM optimizer.
- (work in Progress)....

### Results and Whats Next

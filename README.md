# Retinal-OCT-Classification
Independent Research on Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Topography) image classification, OCT is a non-invasive diagnostic technique highlighting the retina's distinctive layers. This research is following what I have learned with the OpenCV library and working with images. The goal of this project is to learn how to build a neural network with pytorch and enhance my understanding on deep learning concepts. Eventually leading to an end product that is a multi-class OCT image classification model. 


## Research Topics
- AI Applications in Medical Image Classification
- CNN Architecures of VGG-16 and EfficientNet
- Pytorch Implementation

### Pytorch Introduction

### Custom Datasets

### CNN Architecture/ Transfer Learning
- Efficient Net Architecture

- Custom CNN Architecture and Methods

### Models and Techniques
- Primary model choice was EfficientNetv2 with cross entropy loss function and the ADAM optimizer.
- (work in Progress)....

### Whats Next
- Evaluation
  - Metrics Including ()
- Efficient-Netb0v2 Transfer Learned

- Custom Model
